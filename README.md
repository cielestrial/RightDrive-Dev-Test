# RightDrive Dev Test

## Specifications

- I was unable to install Material UI 4, so Material UI 5 was used instead.
- There is no official Enzyme Adapter for React 18 and because I am using Vite instead of CRA, I opted to use Vitest and RTL instead of Jest and Enzyme.
- I'm leaning towards bitquery api as my crypto api of choice, but have yet to settle on it.
